## Test Cases

Detailed test cases are provided in the accompanying spreadsheet (UAT_TEST_CASES.xlsx). Each test case includes:

- Test ID
- Description
- Preconditions
- Steps to execute
- Expected results
- Pass/Fail criteria
- Priority
- Notes

## Testing Process

### Test Execution

1. Testers will be provided with access to the UAT environment and test cases
2. Testers will execute the assigned test cases and record results
3. Testers will report any issues found using the provided issue reporting template
4. Daily status meetings will be held to review progress and address any blockers

### Issue Reporting

Issues should be reported using the following template:

- **Issue ID**: Unique identifier
- **Test Case ID**: Related test case
- **Summary**: Brief description of the issue
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Expected Result**: What should happen
- **Actual Result**: What actually happened
- **Screenshots/Videos**: Visual evidence of the issue
- **Environment**: Browser, device, screen size, etc.
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Priority**: High, Medium, Low

### Issue Severity Definitions

- **Critical**: Feature is completely non-functional, blocking testing
- **High**: Feature works but with significant issues that impact usability
- **Medium**: Feature works with minor issues that don't significantly impact usability
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, typos, or minor UI inconsistencies

## Acceptance Criteria

The AI Customer Service Assistant will be considered ready for deployment when:

1. All critical and high-severity issues have been resolved
2. 95% of test cases pass
3. All core functionality works as expected
4. Performance meets or exceeds the defined metrics
5. User feedback is predominantly positive
