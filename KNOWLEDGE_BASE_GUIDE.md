## Introduction

The knowledge base is the heart of your AI Customer Service Assistant. It contains all the information your chatbot uses to answer customer questions. A well-maintained knowledge base ensures accurate, helpful responses and increases customer satisfaction.

## Knowledge Base Basics

### What is a Knowledge Base?

In the context of your AI Customer Service Assistant, the knowledge base is a collection of:

- **Questions**: The queries customers might ask
- **Alternative Phrasings**: Different ways customers might ask the same question
- **Answers**: The responses your chatbot will provide
- **Categories**: Organizational groups for related content
- **Metadata**: Additional information to help with matching and relevance

### How It Works

When a customer asks a question, the AI:

1. Analyzes the question to understand intent
2. Searches the knowledge base for matching questions
3. Evaluates the best match based on similarity and context
4. Returns the answer associated with the best match
5. Learns from the interaction to improve future responses

## Creating Effective FAQs

### Accessing the FAQ Editor

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Click "Knowledge Base" in the main navigation
3. Click "Add FAQ" to create a new entry

### FAQ Structure

Each FAQ entry consists of:

- **Question**: The primary question customers might ask
- **Alternative Phrasings**: Different ways to ask the same question
- **Answer**: The response your chatbot will provide
- **Category**: The group this FAQ belongs to
- **Tags**: Optional keywords for improved searching
- **Priority**: Importance level (affects matching when multiple options exist)

### Writing Effective Questions

- **Be Specific**: Focus on one topic per question
- **Use Customer Language**: Phrase questions how customers would ask them
- **Keep It Simple**: Use clear, straightforward language
- **Be Concise**: Avoid unnecessary words
- **Include Keywords**: Use terms customers are likely to search for

Examples:

✅ "What are your business hours?"  
✅ "How do I return a product?"  
✅ "Do you offer free shipping?"  
❌ "Hours of operation for our company's various locations and departments"  
❌ "What is the process for initiating a return of merchandise and obtaining a refund?"

### Adding Alternative Phrasings

For each question, add 3-5 alternative ways customers might ask the same thing:

Primary Question: "What are your business hours?"

Alternative Phrasings:
- "When are you open?"
- "What time do you close?"
- "What days are you open?"
- "Are you open on weekends?"
- "Store hours?"

### Writing Effective Answers

- **Be Direct**: Answer the question clearly and immediately
- **Be Concise**: Keep answers brief (2-3 sentences when possible)
- **Be Helpful**: Provide all necessary information
- **Use Formatting**: Use bold, lists, etc. to improve readability
- **Include Links**: Add links to relevant pages when appropriate
- **Be Conversational**: Write in a natural, friendly tone

Example:

✅ "Our business hours are Monday to Friday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Saturday from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and we are closed on Sunday. You can also reach us 24/7 through our online contact form."

❌ "We are operational during standard business hours throughout the work week and for a limited duration on Saturdays, with Sunday being our designated day of closure."

### Using Markdown in Answers
