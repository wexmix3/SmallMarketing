# AI Customer Service Assistant - Integration Test Plan

This document outlines the integration testing approach for the AI Customer Service Assistant with advanced features.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify that all components work together correctly
2. Ensure that the performance optimizations don't break functionality
3. Test the system under various conditions and loads
4. Identify any integration issues between features
5. Validate that the system meets performance requirements

## Test Environment

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile devices (iOS, Android)
- Various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Different network conditions (fast, slow, intermittent)

| RD-05 | Test with different text sizes/zoom levels | UI remains usable with different accessibility settings | Medium |

## Test Execution

### Test Procedure

1. Set up the test environment
2. Execute each test case
3. Record results (Pass/Fail/Partial)
4. Document any issues found
5. Retest after fixes

### Test Data

- Sample questions for each intent
- Various file types for upload testing
- Scripts for generating large conversations

### Test Tools

- Browser developer tools for performance monitoring
- Browser console for error logging
- Performance monitoring built into the chatbot
- Screen recording for capturing issues

## Issue Tracking

Issues will be categorized as:

- **Critical**: Prevents core functionality from working
- **Major**: Significant feature not working correctly
- **Minor**: Non-critical issue that doesn't prevent usage
- **Enhancement**: Suggestion for improvement

## Test Reporting

A test report will be generated with:

- Summary of test results
- Detailed test case results
- Issues found and their severity
- Performance metrics
- Recommendations for improvements

## Acceptance Criteria

The integration testing will be considered successful when:

1. All high-priority tests pass
2. No critical issues remain
3. Performance meets or exceeds requirements
4. All features work correctly together
5. The system works correctly across all supported environments
