## Potential Questions and Answers

### Q: How does the chatbot handle sensitive customer information?

**A**: "The chatbot is designed with privacy and security in mind. We don't store sensitive customer information in the chat history, and all data is encrypted in transit. In Phase 3, we'll be implementing additional security features, including data encryption at rest and compliance with relevant regulations."

### Q: Can the chatbot be integrated with our existing CRM system?

**A**: "Yes, that's one of the key features planned for Phase 3. We'll be building integrations with popular CRM systems, including [mention specific systems]. This will allow the chatbot to access customer information, create and update tickets, and provide a more personalized experience."

### Q: How does the chatbot handle languages other than English?

**A**: "Currently, the chatbot primarily supports English, but we've designed it with multilingual support in mind. In Phase 3, we'll be implementing full multilingual capabilities, including language detection, translation services, and language-specific response templates."

### Q: What happens if the chatbot can't answer a question?

**A**: "The chatbot is designed to gracefully handle situations where it doesn't have an answer. It will acknowledge that it doesn't know the answer and offer to connect the customer with a human agent or suggest alternative resources. In Phase 3, we'll be enhancing this with more sophisticated fallback mechanisms and learning from these interactions to improve future responses."

### Q: How customizable is the chatbot for different business needs?

**A**: "The chatbot is highly customizable. Businesses can define their own intents, responses, and knowledge base content. In Phase 3, we'll be adding a user-friendly administration interface that will make it even easier to customize the chatbot without technical expertise."
