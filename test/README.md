```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- MongoDB (for backend testing)
- Redis (for caching and session testing)

### Setting Up the Test Environment

To set up the test environment, run:

```bash
node setup-test-environment.js
```

This script will:
1. Check for required system dependencies
2. Install necessary npm packages
3. Create environment configuration files
4. Set up test data
5. Configure test frameworks
6. Update package.json with test scripts
7. Create sample test files

### Generating Test Data

The framework includes a test data generator that can create various types of test data:

```javascript
// Example usage
const dataGenerator = require('./utils/test-data-generator');

// Generate 10 random users
const users = dataGenerator.generateUsers(10);

// Generate 5 random conversations
const conversations = dataGenerator.generateConversations(5);

// Generate a knowledge base with 15 entries
const knowledgeBase = dataGenerator.generateKnowledgeBase(15);

// Generate industry-specific data
const retailData = dataGenerator.generateIndustryData('Retail');

// Generate a complete test data set
const completeData = dataGenerator.generateCompleteTestData();
```

To generate sample data files, run:

```bash
node test/utils/generate-sample-data.js
```

This will create sample data files in the `test/data` directory.

### Running Tests

To run tests, use the `execute-tests.js` script:

```bash
# Run all tests
node execute-tests.js

# Run specific test types
node execute-tests.js unit api

# Run tests with report generation
node execute-tests.js --report

# Run tests in a specific environment
node execute-tests.js --env=testing
```

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the functionality of individual components in isolation. They are located in the `test/unit` directory and are run using Jest.

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### API Tests

API tests verify the functionality of backend API endpoints. They are located in the `test/api` directory and are run using Jest with Supertest.

```bash
npm run test:api
```

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify the functionality of the entire application from the user's perspective. They are located in the `cypress/integration` directory and are run using Cypress.

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Performance Tests

Performance tests verify the performance characteristics of the application. They are located in the `test/performance` directory.

```bash
npm run test:performance
```

### Security Tests

Security tests verify the security of the application. They are located in the `test/security` directory.

```bash
npm run test:security
```

### Accessibility Tests

Accessibility tests verify the accessibility of the application. They are located in the `test/accessibility` directory.

```bash
npm run test:accessibility
```

## Test Reports

Test reports are generated in the `test-reports` directory when running tests with the `--report` flag. The reports include:

- Test results summary
- Test coverage information
- Performance metrics
- Screenshots and videos of failed tests
- Detailed error information

## Test Data

Test data is stored in the `test/data` directory. This includes:

- Sample users
- Sample conversations
- Knowledge base entries
- Industry-specific data
- Widget configurations
- Performance metrics
- AI quality metrics

## Contributing

When adding new tests, please follow these guidelines:

1. Place tests in the appropriate directory based on test type
2. Follow the naming convention: `[component-name].[test-type].js`
3. Use the provided test utilities and data generators
4. Ensure tests are independent and do not rely on external state
5. Include appropriate assertions and error messages
6. Document any special setup or teardown requirements

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the test framework, try these steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Check environment configuration files in the `test/config` directory
3. Verify that MongoDB and Redis are running (if required)
4. Check for error messages in the test output
5. Try running a single test to isolate the issue

If problems persist, please contact the development team for assistance.
