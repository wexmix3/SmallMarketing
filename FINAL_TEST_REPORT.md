## Issues Fixed

### Major Issues Fixed

1. **UI Responsiveness with Multiple Large Images**
   - **Issue**: The UI became unresponsive after uploading 5+ large images in succession.
   - **Fix**: Implemented lazy loading for images, added loading="lazy" attribute, and improved error handling for image loading.
   - **Result**: UI remains responsive even when uploading multiple large images.

2. **Context Loss After File Upload**
   - **Issue**: Conversation context was lost after file uploads, causing the chatbot to treat follow-up questions as new conversations.
   - **Fix**: Updated the file upload handling to properly update the conversation context, added file-specific intents, and improved suggested actions for file uploads.
   - **Result**: Context is now properly maintained after file uploads, allowing for natural follow-up questions.

### Minor Issues Fixed

1. **File Upload Preview**: Improved image preview loading with better error handling and parent node checking.
2. **Feedback Thank You Message**: Enhanced visibility of feedback acknowledgment with better error handling.
3. **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory usage during large conversations and when handling multiple images.
