# AI Customer Service Assistant - Integration Testing

This document provides an overview of the integration testing approach for the AI Customer Service Assistant.

## Overview

Integration testing verifies that different components of the AI Customer Service Assistant work together correctly. This includes testing the interaction between the UI, message handling, AI responses, file uploads, feedback mechanisms, and performance optimizations.

## Test Framework

The integration testing framework consists of:

1. **Test Plan**: A comprehensive plan outlining test objectives, categories, and specific test cases
2. **Test Runner**: A JavaScript-based test runner that executes tests and reports results
3. **Test Helpers**: Utility functions to interact with the chatbot during tests
4. **Test Implementation**: Specific test cases for each feature and cross-feature interactions
5. **Test Reporting**: Tools to generate detailed test reports

## Running Tests

### Manual Testing

To run tests manually in the browser:

1. Open `integration-test-runner.html` in a web browser
2. Use the UI to run all tests or specific test categories
3. View test results in real-time
4. Generate a test report when complete

### Automated Testing

To run tests automatically (requires Node.js and npm):

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all integration tests
npm run test:chatbot:integration

# Run tests in headless mode
npm run test:chatbot:integration:headless

# Run tests for a specific category
npm run test:chatbot:integration:core
npm run test:chatbot:integration:ai
npm run test:chatbot:integration:files
npm run test:chatbot:integration:feedback
npm run test:chatbot:integration:performance
npm run test:chatbot:integration:responsive
npm run test:chatbot:integration:cross

# Generate a test report
npm run test:chatbot:integration:report
```

## Test Categories

The integration tests are organized into the following categories:

### 1. Core Functionality Tests (CF)

Tests basic chatbot functionality such as sending messages, receiving responses, and UI controls.

### 2. File Attachment Tests (FA)

Tests file upload functionality, including single and multiple file uploads, different file types, and error handling.

### 3. Enhanced AI Tests (AI)

Tests AI capabilities such as intent recognition, context awareness, and handling of various question types.

### 4. Feedback Mechanism Tests (FM)

Tests the feedback system, including positive and negative feedback, changing feedback, and feedback persistence.

### 5. Performance Optimization Tests (PO)

Tests performance features such as virtual scrolling, response caching, and handling of large conversations.

### 6. Cross-Feature Integration Tests (XF)

Tests interactions between different features, such as uploading files and then giving feedback.

### 7. Responsive Design Tests (RD)

Tests the chatbot's behavior on different screen sizes and orientations.

## Test Implementation

Test cases are implemented in `integration-test-implementation.js`. Each test follows this pattern:

```javascript
testRunner.addTest(
    'TEST-ID',
    'Test description',
    async (runner) => {
        // Test implementation
        // ...
        
        // Assertions
        runner.assert(condition, 'Error message if condition fails');
    },
    'Test Category',
    'Priority'
);
```

## Test Helpers

The `ChatbotTestHelpers` object provides utility functions for interacting with the chatbot:

- `sendMessage`: Sends a message and waits for a response
- `uploadFile`: Uploads a file and waits for acknowledgment
- `giveFeedback`: Gives feedback on a message
- `openChat`: Opens the chat window
- `closeChat`: Closes the chat window
- `generateLargeConversation`: Generates a large number of messages
- `checkVirtualScrolling`: Verifies that virtual scrolling is working

## Test Reporting

After running tests, a detailed report can be generated with:

- Test results by category
- Issues found, categorized by severity
- Performance metrics
- Recommendations for improvements
- Next steps

## Continuous Integration

The integration tests can be run as part of a CI/CD pipeline using the `run-integration-tests.js` script, which:

1. Launches a headless browser
2. Loads the test runner
3. Executes the tests
4. Generates a test report
5. Returns an appropriate exit code based on test results

## Extending the Tests

To add new tests:

1. Identify the appropriate test category
2. Add a new test case to `integration-test-implementation.js`
3. Implement the test logic using the test runner and helpers
4. Add assertions to verify expected behavior
5. Run the tests to verify the new test case works correctly

## Troubleshooting

If tests are failing:

1. Check the test log for specific error messages
2. Verify that the chatbot is functioning correctly
3. Check for timing issues (may need to adjust wait times)
4. Verify that selectors are correct (element IDs, classes, etc.)
5. Check for browser compatibility issues
