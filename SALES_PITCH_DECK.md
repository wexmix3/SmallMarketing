## Slide 2: The Problem

**Small Businesses Face Big Customer Service Challenges**

* **Limited Resources**: Can't afford dedicated customer service staff
* **Time Constraints**: Owners and staff stretched too thin
* **24/7 Expectations**: Customers expect immediate responses at all hours
* **Inconsistent Service**: Quality varies depending on who responds
* **Scaling Difficulties**: Service quality suffers as business grows

*"I lose customers because I can't respond fast enough, but I can't afford to hire more staff."*
— Local Retail Store Owner

## Slide 3: The Cost of Poor Customer Service

**Bad Customer Service Hurts Your Bottom Line**

* 78% of customers have abandoned a purchase due to poor service
* It costs 5x more to acquire a new customer than retain an existing one
* 91% of unhappy customers will simply leave without complaining
* 86% of customers will pay more for better customer experience
* One negative experience requires 12 positive ones to make up for it

**For a small business, each lost customer represents significant lost revenue.**
