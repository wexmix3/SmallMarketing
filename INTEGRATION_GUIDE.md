## Website Integration

### Basic Embed

The simplest way to add the AI Customer Service Assistant to your website is using the embed code:

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" → "Integration"
3. Copy the embed code
4. Paste the code just before the closing `</body>` tag on your website

Basic embed code example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.aiassistant.com/embed.js" 
        data-assistant-id="your-assistant-id" 
        data-position="bottom-right" 
        data-primary-color="#0071e3">
</script>
```

### Advanced Configuration

You can customize the embed code with additional data attributes:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.aiassistant.com/embed.js" 
        data-assistant-id="your-assistant-id" 
        data-position="bottom-right" 
        data-primary-color="#0071e3"
        data-theme="light"
        data-welcome-message="Hello! How can I assist you today?"
        data-auto-open="false"
        data-auto-open-delay="5000"
        data-show-avatar="true"
        data-hide-on-mobile="false"
        data-z-index="9999"
        data-width="360"
        data-height="500">
</script>
```

For a complete list of data attributes, see the [Configuration Reference](CONFIGURATION_REFERENCE.md).

### Multiple Page Integration

When integrating the chatbot across multiple pages, consider these best practices:

1. **Consistent Placement**: Use the same position across all pages
2. **Context Awareness**: Pass page-specific context to the chatbot
3. **Conversation Persistence**: Maintain conversation state across pages
4. **Selective Display**: Show/hide on specific pages based on relevance

#### Passing Page Context

Add page-specific context to help the chatbot provide more relevant responses:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.aiassistant.com/embed.js" 
        data-assistant-id="your-assistant-id" 
        data-page-context="product-page"
        data-page-title="Premium Wireless Headphones"
        data-page-url="/products/premium-wireless-headphones">
</script>
```

#### Selective Display

Show or hide the chatbot on specific pages:

```html
<script>
  // Define pages where the chatbot should be hidden
  window.AIAssistantConfig = {
    hideOnPaths: ['/checkout', '/thank-you', '/admin'],
    showOnPaths: ['/support', '/contact', '/products/*']
  };
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.aiassistant.com/embed.js"

   - Ensure integrations comply with GDPR, CCPA, etc.
   - Update privacy policies to reflect data sharing
   - Implement data subject request handling

2. **Industry Standards**:
   - Follow security best practices for your industry
   - Consider compliance requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
   - Document compliance measures

### Monitoring

1. **Activity Logging**:
   - Log all integration activities
   - Monitor for unusual patterns
   - Set up alerts for potential issues

2. **Regular Audits**:
   - Periodically review integration security
   - Test for vulnerabilities
   - Update integrations as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Integration Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**:
