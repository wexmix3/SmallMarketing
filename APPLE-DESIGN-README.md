## How to Use

```javascript
import { colors, typography, borders, animations } from '../../styles/appleDesignTokens';
```

### 2. Use the Chat Interface Component

```javascript
import AppleLikeChatInterface from '../../components/chatbot/AppleLikeChatInterface';

// In your component
<AppleLikeChatInterface
  messages={messages}
  onSendMessage={handleSendMessage}
  suggestedActions={suggestedActions}
  onActionClick={handleActionClick}
  isLoading={isLoading}
  businessName="Your Business"
  businessLogo="/your-logo.png"
  theme="system" // 'light', 'dark', or 'system'
  position="right" // 'left' or 'right'
  language="en"
  onLanguageChange={handleLanguageChange}
  supportedLanguages={supportedLanguages}
  initialOpen={false}
  unreadCount={0}
/>
```

### 3. View the Demo

Navigate to `/demo/apple-chat` to see the chat interface in action.

## Customization

### Colors

You can customize the colors in `appleDesignTokens.js` to match your brand while maintaining the Apple-inspired aesthetic:

```javascript
// Example: Change primary color
export const colors = {
  // Primary colors
  primary: '#0071e3', // Change to your brand color
  primaryDark: '#2997ff', // Lighter version for dark mode
  
  // Other colors...
};
```

### Typography

You can adjust the typography settings to match your brand's font:

```javascript
export const typography = {
  fontFamily: 'Your-Font, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "San Francisco", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif',
  // Other typography settings...
};
```

## Integration with Existing Code

To integrate this design with your existing AI Customer Service Assistant:

1. Copy the components and styles to your project
2. Replace your current chat interface with `AppleLikeChatInterface`
3. Map your data structure to the expected props format
4. Adjust the styling as needed to match your brand

## Best Practices

- Maintain the clean, minimalist aesthetic when making customizations
- Use subtle animations sparingly to enhance the user experience
- Ensure high contrast ratios for accessibility
- Test thoroughly in both light and dark modes
- Keep the interface responsive for all device sizes

## Browser Compatibility

The implementation uses modern CSS features and is compatible with:

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 54+
- Safari 10.1+
- Edge 16+

For older browsers, consider adding appropriate polyfills or fallbacks.

## Performance Considerations

- The components use React's memo and useCallback hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Animations are hardware-accelerated where possible
- SVG icons are used instead of icon fonts for better performance
- Styled-components are used for CSS-in-JS with minimal runtime overhead

## Conclusion

This Apple-inspired design will give your AI Customer Service Assistant a premium, high-tech feel that users will love. The modular approach makes it easy to maintain and extend, while the attention to detail in animations and interactions creates a delightful user experience.
