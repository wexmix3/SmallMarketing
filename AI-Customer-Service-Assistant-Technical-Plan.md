# AI Customer Service Assistant - Technical Implementation Plan

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 High-Level Architecture

The AI Customer Service Assistant will be built as a modular component within the existing marketing platform, following a microservices architecture pattern. The system will consist of:

1. **Chat Widget Frontend**: A customizable React component that can be embedded in client websites
2. **Admin Dashboard**: Integration with the existing marketing platform dashboard
3. **AI Service**: Backend service for natural language processing and response generation
4. **Knowledge Base Service**: System for storing and retrieving business-specific information
5. **Integration Service**: Connectors to third-party systems (calendars, CRMs, etc.)
6. **Analytics Service**: Data collection and reporting on chatbot performance

### 1.2 Technology Stack

Building on the existing marketing platform stack:

- **Frontend**: React.js/TypeScript with Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, with specialized storage for conversation history
- **AI/ML**: Integration with OpenAI GPT or Anthropic Claude APIs
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets for live chat functionality
- **Authentication**: Leverage existing auth system with role-based access control
- **Deployment**: Vercel (matching existing platform deployment)
